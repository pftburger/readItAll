I'm a long—term fan ofApple, having used their products since the days ofthe
Apple II computer. I loved the products so much that in 1993 I leﬂ my University
job and moved to Apple where 1 established the User Experience Architect's
orriee. Afterwards I became Vice President ofApple's Advanced Technology
Group. Indeed, I am typing this on an Apple computer.
