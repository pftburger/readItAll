I'm a long-term fan of Apple, having used their products since the days of the
Apple II computer. I loved the products so much that in 1993 I left my University
job and moved to Apple where I established the User Experience Architect's
Office. Afterwards I became Vice President of Apple's Advanced Techntlgy
Group. Indeed, I am typing this on an Apple computer.
